This listing is organized by section.  
For example, memory_db would be set by adding `memory_db = true` under the line `[discord]`

#### discord
* memory_db (true or false, default false) - if true, Discord data will be kept in memory as opposed to on disk
* token (string) - Discord token used to login, this can be set from the menu
* prefetch (true or false, default false) - if true, new messages will cause the avatar and image attachments to be automatically downloaded

#### http
* user_agent (string) - sets the user-agent to use in HTTP requests to the Discord API (not including media/images)
* concurrent (int, default 10) - how many images can be concurrently retrieved

#### gui
* member_list_discriminator (true or false, default true) - show user discriminators in the member list
* emojis (true or false, default true) - resolve unicode and custom emojis to images. this needs to be false to allow GTK to render emojis by itself
* css (string) - path to the main CSS file
* animations (true or false, default true) - use animated images where available (e.g. server icons, emojis, avatars). false means static images will be used

#### misc
